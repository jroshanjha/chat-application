🚀 Project: Free NLP Toolkit with Hugging Face + LangChain
🎯 Goal

Build a single package in Google Colab that lets you do 4 key NLP tasks for free:

Chatbot – GPT2, Falcon, Mistral, etc.

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) – use embeddings + vector search.

Summarization – BART Large CNN.

Question Answering – DistilBERT on SQuAD.

This becomes like your personal NLP lab 🧪 you can extend later.

📂 Project Structure in Colab

Since Colab doesn’t use file trees like local projects, we’ll structure it as modules inside one notebook:

Section 1: Install Dependencies

Section 2: Define Functions (chatbot, rag, summarize, answer_question)

Section 3: Interactive Menu (CLI inside Colab)

Section 4: (Optional) Streamlit UI if you want web-style

⚙️ How It Works

Uses Hugging Face free models (downloads automatically in Colab).

Runs fully free on Colab CPU/GPU.

No OpenAI key, no paid API.

Extensible → you can replace GPT2 with Falcon, Mistral, or Llama 2 later.

📊 Example Workflow

Chatbot Mode

Input: "Hello, explain AI to me"

Model: gpt2

Output: "AI is about creating machines that can mimic human intelligence..."

RAG Mode

Documents: ["LangChain is a framework...", "Machine learning is a subset of AI"]

Query: "What is LangChain?"

Answer: "LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications."

Summarization Mode

Input: Long article

Model: facebook/bart-large-cnn

Output: Short summary (~2-3 sentences).

QA Mode

Context: "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991"

Question: "Who created Python?"

Answer: "Guido van Rossum"

🔮 Extensions (Future Work)

Replace GPT2 with Mistral 7B / Falcon 7B for stronger chat.

Store embeddings in FAISS / Chroma DB for larger RAG datasets.

Add speech-to-text (Whisper) + text-to-speech (Coqui) for voice assistant.

Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.
